// A program you submit to Distributed Code Jam will be compiled by Google, and
// will run on multiple computers (nodes). This library describes the interface
// needed for the nodes to identify themselves and to communicate.
//
// This is the version of the interface for programs written in Java. Your
// program doesn't need to import it and should always use a class name before
// accessing the static methods, e.g.:
// int n = message.NumberOfNodes();
public class message {

	// The number of nodes on which the solution is running.
	public static int NumberOfNodes() {throw new RuntimeException();}

	// The index (in the range [0 .. NumberOfNodes()-1]) of the node on which this
	// process is running.
	public static int MyNodeId() {throw new RuntimeException();}

	// In all the functions below, if "target" or "source" is not in the valid
	// range, the behaviour is undefined.

	// The library internally has a message buffer for each of the nodes in
	// [0 .. NumberOfNodes()-1]. It accumulates the message in such a buffer through
	// the "Put" methods.

	// Append "value" to the message that is being prepared for the node with id
	// "target". The "Int" in PutInt is interpreted as 32 bits, regardless of
	// whether the actual int type will be 32 or 64 bits.
	public static void PutChar(int target, char value) {throw new RuntimeException();}
	public static void PutInt(int target, int value) {throw new RuntimeException();}
	public static void PutLL(int target, long value) {throw new RuntimeException();}

	// Send the message that was accumulated in the appropriate buffer to the
	// "target" instance, and clear the buffer for this instance.
	//
	// This method is non-blocking - that is, it does not wait for the receiver to
	// call "Receive", it returns immediately after sending the message.
	public static void Send(int target) {throw new RuntimeException();}

	// The library also has a receiving buffer for each instance. When you call
	// "Receive" and retrieve a message from an instance, the buffer tied to this
	// instance is overwritten. You can then retrieve individual parts of the
	// message through the Get* methods. You must retrieve the contents of the
	// message in the order in which they were appended.
	//
	// This method is blocking - if there is no message to receive, it will wait for
	// the message to arrive.
	//
	// You can call Receive(-1) to retrieve a message from any source, or with
	// source in [0 .. NumberOfNodes()-1] to retrieve a message from a particular
	// source.
	//
	// It returns the number of the instance which sent the message (which is equal
	// to source, unless source is -1).
	public static int Receive(int source) {throw new RuntimeException();}

	// Each of these methods returns and consumes one item from the buffer of the
	// appropriate instance. You must call these methods in the order in which the
	// elements were appended to the message (so, for instance, if the message was
	// created with PutChar, PutChar, PutLL, you must call GetChar, GetChar, GetLL
	// in this order).
	// If you call them in different order, or you call a Get* method after
	// consuming all the contents of the buffer, behaviour is undefined.
	// The "Int" in GetInt is interpreted as 32 bits, regardless of whether the
	// actual int type will be 32 or 64 bits.
	public static char GetChar(int source) {throw new RuntimeException();}
	public static int GetInt(int source) {throw new RuntimeException();}
	public static long GetLL(int source) {throw new RuntimeException();}
