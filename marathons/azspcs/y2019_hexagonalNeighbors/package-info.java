In this contest we will fill regular hexagonal grids1 with positive integers so that when a cell contains some integer k, the integers 1, 2, â€¦, k-1 will be among that cell's neighbors2. Figure 1 is an example.

1A hexagonal grid is a grid whose cells are regular hexagons. A regular hexagonal grid is one that has six sides and has the same number of cells along each side. A regular hexagonal grid has n3 - (n - 1)3 cells, where n is the number of hexagons on each side, and is said to be "order n".

2We consider two cells to be neighbors if they share a side. Interior cells, for example, have 6 neighbors and corner cells have 3.

The Contest
For each value of n from 3 through 27 submit an order n hexagonal grid as described above. Your objective, for each n, is to maximize the sum of the grid's cells. For example, in Figure 1 the sum of the cells is 47.

For each value of n you can submit more than one grid, but only your best grid will count.
